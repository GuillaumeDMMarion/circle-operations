# Circle Operations

This repository implements basic point/circle operations in a series of classes and methods.
The original goal was to create a method to calculate total area of overlapping circles (while overlapping areas would be included only once).

## Functionalities

Some examples of the classes' methods that were needed to achieve the above:

* Distance
* Centroid
* Polygon Area
* Angle Offset
* Intersection
* Intersection Cord
* Circular Segment
* Intersection Area

## Numpy superclass

The classes are built on top of numpy.ndarrays with the purpose to make most methods vectorized, making the code work a bit more complex but easier to execute.

## More info

Refer to the jupyter notebook for a detailed step-by-step explanation of the whole process.
