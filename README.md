# Circle Operations

This repository implements basic point/circle operations in a series of classes and methods.
Final goal is to create a method to calculate total area of overlapping circles (while overlapping areas are included only once).

## Functionalities

Some examples of the classes' functionalities:

* Distance
* Centroid
* Polygon Area
* Angle Offset
* Intersection
* Intersection Cord
* Circular Segment
* Intersection Area

## Numpy superclass

The classes are built on top of numpy.ndarrays with the purpose to make most methods vectorized.

## To Do

* Intersection of 3+ circles
* Overlapping manager
